\paragraph{Exercise 11.1}
Prove \textsl{Cayley's theorem}: Any group $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of
the symmetric group on $G$, \Sym{G}.

\begin{proof}

For any $a \in G$, consider the following function $F_a: G \rightarrow G$:
$$F_a(x) = a x$$
\begin{itemize}
    \item $F_a$ is one-to-one, since $F_a(x) = a x = a y = F_a(y)$ implies 
    that $x = y$ (left multiplying by \Inv{a}).
    \item $F_a$ is onto: for a given $y \in G$, $F_a(\Inv{a} y) = a (\Inv{a} y)
    = (a \Inv{a}) y = y$.
\end{itemize}
Thus, $F_a$ is a bijection on $G$, which in turn means that $F_a$ is a permutation
of the elements in $G$. Thus, $S = \{ F_a \, / \, a \in G \}$ is a subset of \Sym{G}.
Moreover, $S$ is a subgroup of \Sym{G}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$ contains the identity permutation: $F_{\Id{G}}(x) = \Id{G} \, x = x$.
    \item $S$ is closed by composition: $(F_a \circ F_b)(x) = F_a(F_b(x)) = a (b x)
    = (a b) x = F_{ab}(x)$.
    \item $S$ is closed by inverses: $\Inv{F_a} = F_{\Inv{a}}$, since
    $(F_a \circ F_{\Inv{a}})(x) = a (\Inv{a} x) = x$.
\end{itemize}
Let $\mathcal{F} : G \rightarrow S$  be a function defined as follows:
$$\mathcal{F}(a) = F_a$$
Then, $\mathcal{F}$ is a group isomorphism from $G$ to $S$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{F}(ab) = F_{ab} = F_a \circ F_b =
    \mathcal{F}(a) \circ \mathcal{F}(b)$, using that $S$ is closed by composition.
    \item $\mathcal{F}$ is one-to-one, since $\mathcal{F}(a) = \mathcal{F}(b)$
    implies that $F_a(x) = a x = b x = F_b(x)$, and so $a = b$ after right
    multiplying by \Inv{x}.
    \item $\mathcal{F}$ is onto, since for a given $F_a \in S$, $\mathcal{F}(a) = F_a$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Exercise 11.2}
What is the order of $S_n$?

\begin{proof}[Answer]
$S_n$ contains every permutation of $\{1,\dots,n\}$. Since there are $n!$ of
them, the order of $S_n$ is $n!$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Exercise 11.3}
Prove that, if $n > 2$, $S_n$ is not abelian.

\begin{proof}
Let $P_1 = (2 \, 1 \, 3 \, \dots \, n)$ and let
$P_2 = (3 \, 1 \, 2 \, \dots \, n)$. Then,
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P_1 \circ P_2 = (1 \, 3 \, 2 \, \dots \, n)$, and
    \item $P_2 \circ P_1 = (3 \, 2 \, 1 \, \dots \, n)$.
\end{itemize}
Since $P_1 \circ P_2 \neq P_2 \circ P_1$, $S_n$ is not commutative.
\end{proof}
